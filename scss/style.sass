SASS is The second, older syntax is known as the indented syntax (or just “.sass”). Inspired by Haml’s terseness, it’s intended for people who prefer conciseness over similarity to CSS. Instead of brackets and semicolons, it uses the indentation of lines to specify blocks. Files in the indented syntax use the extension .sass.

I think most of the time these days if someone mentions that they are working with Sass they are referring to authoring in .scss rather than the traditional .sass way.
